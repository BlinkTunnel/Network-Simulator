Mode support

Gateway Mode: First share your internet connection through Internet-Sharing, and then WNR would shape / interfere the network traffic between your MacBook and your mobile device, just like a router.
Emulator Mode: Just start an Android / iOS emulator, specify the process name in WNR, and then you will have emulated network condition in your virtual machine. In this mode you don't need a real mobile phone.
